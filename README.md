Download the store front webpages and save them to your storage root folder, make sure the page has fully loaded before you download.

The downloaded pages can either be in html. or mhtml format both will work.

Make sure the brands.json file is in your storage root folder.

Copy the contents of the scrapper.py to your Pydroid3 editor and run. You will get the results as CSV files which you can convert to JSON or whichever format you like.

You can update the brands.json with new brands data as currently walmart rate limits scrappers on the site and the elements dynamically change if they detect scrapping
